Foundation helpers for building WP-CLI commands with the Foundation container.

## Installation

```shell
composer require stellarwp/foundation-wpcli
```

WP-CLI is expected to provide the `WP_CLI` and `WP_CLI_Command` runtime classes. This package includes `wp-cli/wp-cli` as a development dependency for tests and static analysis, but applications normally do not need to install it separately when running inside WP-CLI.

Install `stellarwp/foundation-wpcli` as a normal dependency when the plugin ships WP-CLI commands. Install `stellarwp/foundation-cli` separately with `composer require --dev stellarwp/foundation-cli` only when developers need generators such as `make:wpcli-command`.

## Commands

Extend `StellarWP\Foundation\WPCli\Command` for commands that should receive the Foundation container.

## Generating Commands

If the project also installs `stellarwp/foundation-cli` as a development dependency, scaffold a WP-CLI command class in a consuming WordPress project:

```bash
vendor/bin/foundation make:wpcli-command Sync_Products_Command
```

If the consuming project has a Composer script named `foundation` that points to the installed Foundation binary, it can also run `composer run foundation -- make:wpcli-command Sync_Products_Command`.

The generator reads the project's `autoload.psr-4` namespaces from `composer.json` and writes a Snake_Case command class under `Cli/Commands` inside the default PSR-4 root. When `--namespace` is passed, the output path is resolved from the matching PSR-4 root unless `--path` is also passed.

For example, a project with this Composer autoload entry:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Acme\\Plugin\\": "src"
        }
    }
}
```

will generate:

```text
src/Cli/Commands/Sync_Products_Command.php
```

with namespace:

```php
Acme\Plugin\Cli\Commands
```

The generated class extends `StellarWP\Foundation\WPCli\Command` and includes example positional, associative, and flag arguments using constants.

When generated through `foundation-cli`, projects using Strauss with `extra.strauss.namespace_prefix` receive prefixed Foundation imports automatically.

Available options:

```bash
vendor/bin/foundation make:wpcli-command Sync_Products_Command --namespace="Acme\\Plugin\\Cli" --path=src/Cli --subcommand=sync-products --description="Sync products." --force
```

Project stub overrides live under:

```text
foundation/stubs/wpcli/command.stub
```

When present, the override is used instead of the default stub from the `foundation-wpcli` package.

Override stubs should use the same context-aware placeholders as the default stub when writing PHP literals. For example, use `{{ description_php }}` and `{{ subcommand_php }}` for values returned from PHP methods, and `{{ foundation_wpcli_command }}` for the Foundation command import so Strauss-prefixed projects keep working.

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace {{ namespace }};

use {{ foundation_wpcli_command }};

final class {{ class }} extends Command
{
	public function runCommand( array $args = [], array $assocArgs = [] ): int {
		// Run the command using services from $this->container.

		return self::SUCCESS;
	}

	protected function subcommand(): string {
		return {{ subcommand_php }};
	}

	protected function description(): string {
		return {{ description_php }};
	}

	protected function arguments(): array {
		return [
			[
				'type'        => self::FLAG,
				'name'        => 'dry-run',
				'description' => 'Preview the sync without writing changes.',
				'optional'    => true,
			],
		];
	}
}
```

## Provider Setup

Applications should register their own provider so they control the command namespace and command list.

Do not register `StellarWP\Foundation\Cli\CliProvider` in a WordPress plugin. That provider belongs to the developer-facing `foundation` console binary, not plugin runtime bootstrap.

Generated command classes use Strauss-prefixed Foundation imports automatically when `extra.strauss.namespace_prefix` is configured. Handwritten provider code is still application code, so projects using Strauss with `update_call_sites=false` may need to use their prefixed Foundation namespace in the imports below.

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Acme\App\Cli;

use StellarWP\Foundation\Container\Contracts\Provider;
use StellarWP\Foundation\WPCli\Command;
use StellarWP\Foundation\WPCli\TimestampedLogger;
use WP_CLI;
use WP_CLI\Loggers\Regular;

final class Wp_Cli_Provider extends Provider
{
	private const string COMMAND_PREFIX = 'acme';

	/**
	 * @var list<class-string<Command>>
	 */
	private const array COMMANDS = [
		Sync_Command::class,
	];

	public function register(): void {
		if ( ! defined( 'WP_CLI' ) || ! WP_CLI ) {
			return;
		}

		$this->configureCommands();
		$this->registerTimestampedLogger();

		add_action( 'cli_init', function (): void {
			foreach ( self::COMMANDS as $commandClass ) {
				$command = $this->container->get( $commandClass );

				if ( $command instanceof Command ) {
					$command->register();
				}
			}
		}, 0, 0 );
	}

	private function configureCommands(): void {
		foreach ( self::COMMANDS as $commandClass ) {
			$this->container->when( $commandClass )
				->needs( '$commandPrefix' )
				->give( self::COMMAND_PREFIX );
		}
	}

	private function registerTimestampedLogger(): void {
		$wpCliLogger = WP_CLI::get_logger();

		if ( $wpCliLogger instanceof Regular ) {
			WP_CLI::set_logger( new TimestampedLogger( $wpCliLogger ) );
		}
	}
}
```

Use `cli_init` so commands are registered only during WP-CLI command bootstrap, after WordPress has loaded enough for plugin providers and hooks to be available.

If your application does not use WordPress hooks during bootstrap, call the command registration loop at the point where WP-CLI is active and your container has been configured.
